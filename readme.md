# Sentiment Analysis of Greece and Israel Tweets Related to Eurovision 2024

Introduction

This study focuses on sentiment analysis of tweets related to Greece and Israel during the Eurovision Song Contest 2024. Data were collected through Twitter scraping, processed with Python and the TextBlob library, and stored in CSV format on Google Drive.

Israel was included in the analysis due to its heightened media presence following the outbreak of the Gaza conflict. The study aims to capture the emotional dynamics reflected on social media, with full acknowledgment of the seriousness of the events.

## Overview

This project focuses on the collection and sentiment analysis of Twitter data related to Eurovision 2024, with a specific emphasis on discussions involving Greece and Israel.
Data was collected between May 1st and May 15th, 2024, and processed using Python and the TextBlob library for sentiment classification.

Initially, the ```advance_scraper.py``` script was used to locate relevant posts with at least 10 replies. This process generated the file ```Advance2024-05-25_04-20-19_tweets_1-15.csv```, containing 1208 posts.

Subsequently, the URLs of these posts were split into five CSV files for easier management. The ```scraper_comments_from_post.py``` script was then utilized to scrape the replies (tweets) associated with each post.

### Sentiment Analysis of Tweets for Greece and Israel in Eurovision 2024


#### 1. Data Loading

Google Colab was used to access Google Drive and read the combined_unique_eurovision_valid.csv file. Then, a list of dictionaries was created containing the tweets and their timestamps.

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

query = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/combined_unique_eurovision_valid.csv')
tweets = [{'Tweet': row['Content'], 'Timestamp': row['Timestamp']} for index, row in query.iterrows()]
```

---

#### 2. Creating the DataFrame and Cleaning the Data

The tweets were imported into a DataFrame. ```NaN``` values were replaced with empty strings to prevent errors.

```python
df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(tweets)
df['Tweet'] = df['Tweet'].fillna('')
```

---

#### 3. Defining Keywords

Two lists of keywords related to Greece and Israel (such as "Athens," "Greek culture," "Tel Aviv," "Gaza," etc.) were created. These lists were used to identify whether a tweet referred to either of the two countries.

---

#### 4. Topic Identification

A function named ```identify_subject()``` was defined to check if a tweet contains any of the specified keywords.

```python
def identify_subject(tweet, refs):
    flag = 0
    for ref in refs:
        if ref.lower() in tweet.lower():
            flag = 1
    return flag

df['Israel'] = df['Tweet'].apply(lambda x: identify_subject(x, Israel_handle))
df['Greece'] = df['Tweet'].apply(lambda x: identify_subject(x, Greece_handle))
```

---

#### 5. Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob

For each tweet, the sentiment polarity was calculated using the TextBlob library. Polarity values range from -1 (negative sentiment) to +1 (positive sentiment).
```python
from textblob import TextBlob
df['polarity'] = df['Tweet'].apply(lambda x: TextBlob(x).sentiment.polarity)
```

---

#### 6. Timestamp Conversion and Grouping by Date

Timestamps were converted into date format, and a new column with the corresponding dates was created. Tweets were then filtered to include only those from May 1, 2024, onwards.

```python
df['Timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Timestamp'])
df['Date'] = df['Timestamp'].dt.date
start_date = pd.to_datetime('2024-05-01').date()
df = df[df['Date'] >= start_date]
```

---

#### 7. Daily Sentiment Calculation & Rolling Average

For each country:
  - Tweets related to the country were filtered.
  - Tweets were grouped by date.
  - The daily average sentiment polarity was calculated.
  - A rolling mean (with a 3-day window) was also computed.

```python
Greece = df[df['Greece']==1][['Date', 'polarity']].groupby('Date').mean().reset_index()
Greece['MA Polarity'] = Greece.polarity.rolling(3, min_periods=1).mean()

Israel = df[df['Israel']==1][['Date', 'polarity']].groupby('Date').mean().reset_index()
Israel['MA Polarity'] = Israel.polarity.rolling(3, min_periods=1).mean()
```

#### 8. Visualization of Results

A line chart was created to show the trend of the average daily sentiment polarity and its variation over time.


```python
plt.plot(Greece['Date'], Greece['MA Polarity'], label='Greece MA Polarity', color='blue')
plt.plot(Israel['Date'], Israel['MA Polarity'], label='Israel MA Polarity', color='red')
plt.title('Sentiment Polarity Over Time (from May 1st)')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Moving Average Polarity')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

#### Conclusions

From the above analysis, it is possible to track the publicâ€™s emotional reaction to events related to the two countries during the competition.
This methodology can be extended to include more countries or time periods and can incorporate advanced NLP techniques for a more accurate understanding of sentiment.
